If you want to learn how to use CoreData and are looking for a few examples for tableView, you can download a basis for a minimal note application here.
![note_app](https://github.com/SevenAndrew/Notify-iOS17/assets/82178604/d8854683-3e32-447f-a644-cfdbe29b80cb)
This is just a starting point (with a navigation controller) for app development.
This repository serves as an example of CRUD with CoreData.

Three ViewControllers are used in total:

* NoteCategoryViewController

  Categories for notes can be created here. A deletion function has been implemented - delete requires swipe left.

* NoteListViewController

  The individual notes can be created in this ViewController, whereas only the title is created here.
  (This view controller can also be omitted; it was added for demonstration purposes).

  In this view controller, the title and the note's text can be changed and saved.

  Click on the Save button to close the NoteViewController.
