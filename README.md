# Use

If you want to learn how to use CoreData and are looking for a few examples for tableView, you can download a basis for a minimal note-application here.

This is just a framework (navigation controller) as a starting point for app development.

ViewControllers are used in total:

* NoteCategoryViewController

  Categories for notes can be created here. A deletion function has not yet been implemented. In the next version, a delete function will be added using swipe right.

* NoteListViewController

  The individual notes can be created in this bio, whereby only the title is created here.
  (This view controller can also be omitted, it was added for demonstration purposes).

* NoteViewController

  In this view controller, both the title and the text of the note can be changed and saved.

  Click on the Save button to close the NoteViewController.
