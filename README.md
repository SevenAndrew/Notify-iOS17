# Use

If you want to learn how to use CoreData and are looking for a few examples for tableView, you can download a basis for a minimal note application here.

This is just a framework (navigation controller) as a starting point for app development.

ViewControllers are used in total:

* NoteCategoryViewController

  Categories for notes can be created here. A deletion function has not yet been implemented. A delete function will be added in the next version using swipe right.

* NoteListViewController

  The individual notes can be created in this bio, whereas only the title is created here.
  (This view controller can also be omitted; it was added for demonstration purposes).

* NoteViewController

  In this view controller, the title and the note's text can be changed and saved.

  Click on the Save button to close the NoteViewController.
